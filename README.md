I decided to learn React one night during the quarantine so span up this wee app.

I was thinking about going in with a friend to start up a cafe in Australia. When I was doing some quick research on it one night there was an article about ensuring your cafe had a point of difference. There wasn’t much out there in the scope of some kind of idea or theme generator (to spark some creativity). So, decide to see how quick I could pick up a new language that’s been on the list for some time now. I have no patience for a tutorial so just started working on it straight away, working piece by piece to incorporate all the components I needed. Hardest part was having to google "GoDaddy" way too often during this process.

Anyway, the site picks out some random Adjective then a Noun and adds cafe at the end. Easy as.

Here's hoping someone out there makes an apocalyptic vegan cafe.
