I decided to learn React one night during the quarantine so span up this wee app.

I was thinking about going in with a friend to start up a cafe in Australia. When i was doing some quick research on it one night there was an article about ensuring your cafe had a point of difference. There wasnt much out there in the scope of some kind of idea or theme generator ( to spark some creativity). So decide to see how quick I could pick up a new language thats been on the list for some time now. I have no patiece for a tutorial so just started working on it straight away, working piece by piece to incorporate all the components i needed. 
Hardest part was having to google "GoDaddy" way too often during this process. 

Anyway, the site picks out some random Adjective then a Noun and adds cafe at the end. Easy as.
